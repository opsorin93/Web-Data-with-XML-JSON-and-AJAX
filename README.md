## Task 2 - Weather Application based on API Data
 Users should be able to choose a UK country (England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland) from a menu on a HTML page. Depending on which country the user chooses, corresponding city name data for the chosen country should be dynamically loaded into a second menu. The user should then be able to select a city name from the second menu. Upon selection, the weather for the selected city should be retrieved from the API, and displayed as HTML.
